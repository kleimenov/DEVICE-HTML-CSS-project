### Tech descripton and specification

This website includes two web pages. All pages aren't responsive. In this project, I implemented my current HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge, and maximum attention put on sophisticated grids, selectors settings and selectors combination. 

This project is build with the following technologies:
```
- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;

```
Semantic HTML is used for all webpages markup with the elements of block - element - modifier system in class naming. All elements are styled with CSS using the inheritance and cascading rules, and selectors specificity. 

All algorithms  were implemented with JavaScript. This includes DOM manipulation (DOM elements creation and modification).

### Descriptions of JavaScript features 
1) _Modal contact us form_. Implemented algorithm allows to show and hide modal contact form. Algorithm includes follow steps: find modal element inside HTML markup, listen for the event `a user click on the button`, show the modal booking form, get user's data, hide modal form when user click on a particular button. 
2) _Items slider_. Implemented slider algorithm that allows showing different items with description (in this case slider includes three different blocks with item image, description, and specification). Algorithm includes following steps: find the slider holder element inside HTML markup, listen for the event `a user click on the button`, show the particular item slide, another click show the another slide and so on.
